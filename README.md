# IBUS-TV-Modules-RGB-Input
RGB input mode for IBUS equipped IBUS BMW TV modules
IBUS BMW Video modules have RGB analog inputs via the so called jungle chip(TDA8376). RGB inputs are only visible when the TV is activated. Composite input of Rearview Camera or TV Tuner is used as Composite Sync signal. On motherboard blinded pin headers, only RGBIN2 inputs are available for external input, RGBIN1 is dedicated to OSD MCU. According to TDA8376 datasheet: The RGB1 inputs have priority over the RGB2 inputs. Due to that it is not possible to make OSD overlay on RGBIN2. Only way to show OSD is disabling RGBIN2 insertation.
